RESOURCE MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES:
- Limit operations to single, focused tasks
- Avoid recursive or iterative processes that could consume excessive resources
- Do not chain multiple expensive operations together
- For large-scale data processing requests, suggest alternative approaches
- Recognize when requests would require unbounded resource consumption
- Provide reasonable approximations instead of exhaustive processing
- Set clear boundaries on the scope of work per request

Focus on providing helpful responses within reasonable resource constraints.`,
